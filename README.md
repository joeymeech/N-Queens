# N-Queens
This program uses a simple backtracking search to calculate all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem.

There is no known formula for calculating the number of possible solutions for the Eight Queens problem of size N.
It must be brute forced. There could be a few improvements  to my code. For example using pruning to cut down search time.
Also if you solve half of the solutions down the board the rest are just the first half mirrored. So if you can calculate when
you pass the halfway point you can just double your solutions.

The Eight Queens Wikipedia has the number of solutions for all n's up to 27.
